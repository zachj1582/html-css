            <p>
                I'm Zachary Johnson but you can just call me Zach. I was raised in Calgary, Alberta, Canada where I grew
                up playing hockey in the winter and soccer in the summer. In reality the seasons didn't matter, street
                hockey in the summer and soccer in the snow were a common occurence. We spent the weekends on the slopes
                skiing, snowboarding, and generally breaking every rule we could on the slopes or not.

                I was 20 when I moved to Fort Worth, Texas. I kept playing hockey but now spent the weekends on the golf
                course. I picked up a serving job a few weeks after I moved down and loved it! It wasn't long before I
                worked my way into a bartending postion and decided that was my career choice. I was young. It didn't
                take long before I outgrew it and jumped on a manager job offer. In short time I was promoted to General
                Manager and had the good fortune to be able travel helping out under performing stores, training new
                GM's and assisting in new store opens. I'd been thinking about a career change for a couple of years, in
                December I decided it was time and enrolled in DevMountain's coding bootcamp. Which in turn led to a
                great opportunity with TEKsystems and promptly enrolled in their in house bootcamp (Thanks Richika!! Can
                confirm, a good LinkedIn profile can take you places). These days you can find me in front of a computer
                thoroughly enjoying my transition into the Tech industry and trying my best to get this page to load
                with a animated transition...
